### What is this?

stuyDayGrabber is a quick and dirty program to grab the Bell schedule and lab rotation at Stuy. It pulls data from the stuy website and parses it into a readable and easy to use format.
This was initially built for the new *Spectator* website, but I'm not sure if/how/when I will implement it.

### Requirements:

stuyDayGrabber is built with Python 2.7.3, but should work with any 2.7.x or above build. Implementation requires a computer with a python instilation, as well as slight modification to the code for your project (e.g., adding to a HTML site).
