# stuyDayGrabber

### What is this?

stuyDayGrabber is a quick and dirty program to grab the Bell schedule and lab rotation at Stuy. It pulls data from the stuy website and parses it into a readable and easy to use format.
This was initially built for the new *Spectator* website, but I'm not sure if/how/when I will implement it.

### Requirements:

stuyDayGrabber is built with Python 2.7.3, but should work with any 2.7.x or above build. Implementation requires a computer with a python instilation, as well as slight modification to the code for your project (e.g., adding to a HTML site).


### License & Usage:
stuyDayGrabber is an open source program under the MIT License. Please see the License file for details on copyright and usage.
In short, you are free to use/distribute this program for both personal and commercial use (who would use this commercially...?) as long as you attribute me (Andrew Ficher) and include the license file in this repo along with the file.




### ToDo:
- ~~Robustify to make work any weekday~~
  - ~~Need to create function to get link to weekly schedule every week~~ **Done** with commit 
- Find somewhere to implement this...
